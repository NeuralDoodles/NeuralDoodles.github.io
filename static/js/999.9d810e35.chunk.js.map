I am starting this series of write-ups to help my writing process and as a reference for anyone who is in the early stages of writing a paper or thinking about writing one.\nThis is only meant as a starting point for those who need a sight push in the writing process, not as a guide to strictly adhere to, as what you might want to put across in your text can vary from this guideline. <br/>\n\n<br/>\n<h5><b>What to write in an Introduction:</b></h5>\nGenerally, you would like to lay the groundwork for the rest of the paper here.<br/> John Swales (1990) [2] describes it as a CARS (Create A Research Space) model. This includes, in lay terms:\n<br/> \n1. What is it that you are trying to do?<br/> \n2. Why is it important?<br/> \n3. Why has it not been done before / What have others done?<br/> \n4. How is it better than the others?<br/> \n5. What now that it works?<br/> <br/> \nA rough checklist of the points to fill out can look like this:\n\n<br/> - Establishing the context, background and/or importance of the topic\n<br/> - Giving a brief synopsis of the relevant literature (which can be expanded into a “Related Works” section of its own)\n<br/> - Highlighting the inadequacy of previous research, indicating a problem or gap that the work tries to address\n<br/> - Establishing the desirability of the research: what are the benefits of solving the problem and explaining the significance or value of the work\n<br/> - A list of the main contributions of the work\n\n<br/> <br/> \nOther things that can also be addressed in this section include:\n\n<br/>- Defining certain key terms to be used later in the work\n<br/>- Listing the research questions or hypotheses\n<br/>- Providing a synopsis of the research method(s)\n<br/>- Providing an overview of the paper structure<br/> <br/> \n\n\n<h5><b>General Phrases one can use for bringing across a point:</b></h5>\n1.
